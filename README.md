# python_challenge
This repository contains all the files and folders needed for the module 3 challenge, PyBank and PyPoll
Each contains code that can be run in  Jupytr notebook and VScode (.ipynb and .py)
To ensure proper operation of the code, confirm that the proper CSVs are in the "Resources" folders for both scripts

## Instructions:
1. Download the repository
2. The script for PyBank is in the PyBank folder, titled main.py/ipynb
3. The script for PyBank is in the PyBank folder, also titled main.py/ipynb 
4. ensure the correct CSVs are in the resources folder for each script

## Jupyter
1. If using Jupytr, run open Jupyter notebook and navigate to the "main.ipynb" for whichever challenge part you would like to run
2. Run each code block in order from top to bottom
3. Check the "analysis" folder and ensure the text file properly displays the printed output

## Any other script writers
1. If using VScode or any other script program simply open "main.py" run the code
2. Check the "analysis" folder and ensure the text file properly displays the printed output
